# CTI Integration Lab

## Objective

To deploy and configure an OpenCTI server integrated with the OTX AlienVault threat intelligence feed to centralize, manage, and correlate indicators of compromise—such as IP addresses, domains, and file hashes—enhancing the detection and analysis of potential threats within a SOC environment.


### Skills Learned

- Acquired hands-on experience in deploying and configuring OpenCTI for centralized threat intelligence management.
- Learned to integrate external CTI feeds, specifically OTX AlienVault, for automated threat data ingestion.
- Developed skills in analyzing and correlating indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as IPs, domains, and file hashes.
- Gained practical understanding of SOC operations and threat detection workflows using real-world intelligence data.
- Enhanced Linux administration, API integration, and technical documentation capabilities.
- 
### Tools Used
- OpenCTI – Open-source threat intelligence platform for managing and correlating CTI data.
- OTX AlienVault – External threat intelligence feed providing real-time indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Splunk – Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool for log analysis, data correlation, and visualization.
- Ubuntu – Operating system used to host both the OpenCTI and Splunk servers.
- Docker & Docker Compose – Used for deploying and managing OpenCTI and its dependencies.
- API Integrations – Utilized for connecting OpenCTI with OTX AlienVault and Splunk.
